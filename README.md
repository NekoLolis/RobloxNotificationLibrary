# NekoLolis Notification Library
This documentation is for the stable release of NekoLolis Notification Library.

## Booting the Library
```lua
local library = loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NekoLolis/RobloxNotificationLibrary/main/main.lua')))()
```



## Creating a Notification
```lua
library:CreateNotification("Title Text", "Body Text", "type")

--[[
Title = <string> - The name of the Notification.
Body = <string> - The Notification Text.
Type = <string> - The type of notification, success, info or error.
]]
```

## This Is Fairly Short Since There's Not Much To It, Thanks For Using My Library :)
